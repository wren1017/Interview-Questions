 * Question 1: Social network connectivity
 *
 * Given a social network containing N members and a log file containing M
 * timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an
 * algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected
 * (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend).
 * Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an
 * equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be MlogN or
 * better and use extra space proportional to N.
